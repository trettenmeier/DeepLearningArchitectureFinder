# DeepLearningArchitectureFinder
This is my very first Python/ML application. It is meant to automatically find a fitting architecture for training a Convolutional Neural Network. For that purpose it uses a genetic algorithm.

The dataset I used is the Tiny-Imagenet-200 dataset. The folder structure of the validation set has been slightly modified to work with fit_generator()-method. Modification can be applied with the two scripts provided in the Helpers-Folder.
